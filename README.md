## Customization

To customize the app according to your preferences, follow these steps:

1. **PIN Modification**:
   - Open the `script.js` file.
   - Locate the section where the PIN is defined (usually near the beginning of the file).
   - Change the value assigned to the PIN variable to your desired code.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // Current PIN
   const pin = "1234";
   
   // Change it to your preferred PIN
   const pin = "5678";
   ```

2. **Section Modification**:
   - Open the `style.css` file.
   - Search for the sections you wish to modify (e.g., food section, apps section, movies section).
   - Make the necessary adjustments to the styles, such as colors, fonts, or layout.

   Example:
   ```css
   /* Current styles for the food section */
   .food-section {
       background-color: #FFF;
       font-size: 16px;
       /* Add or modify styles as needed */
   }
   ```

   Remember to save the files after making your changes.

3. **Testing**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the customized version of the app.

Remember, making changes to the code requires a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Always keep a backup of the original code in case you want to revert to it later.
